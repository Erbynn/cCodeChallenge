THE BEATLES LYRICS
"Tomorrow"

Tomorrow all my troubles seemed so far away.
Now it looks as though they're here to stay.
Oh, I believe in tomorrow.

Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be.
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, tomorrow came suddenly.

Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for tomorrow.

Tomorrow love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in tomorrow.

Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for tomorrow.

Tomorrow love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in tomorrow.
